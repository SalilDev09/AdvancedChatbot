# Advanced Chatbot  

This project is my attempt to build a chatbot that goes beyond the usual one-line answers.  
It’s designed to be smart, secure, and extendable, with a clean structure so I (and anyone else) can experiment with NLP, deep learning, and chatbot ideas.  

---

## What it can do
- Understand queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Carry context over multiple turns in a conversation  
- Give responses that aren’t just random, but actually relevant  
- Easily extendable — new intents, datasets, or models can be plugged in  
- Structured in a way that makes testing and experimenting simple
